      <b>T</b>oday we are gonna discuss about some basic coding one can use to keep-up with the latest DC manga releases and episode AIRs.
  <p>
      As well all know that recently the Episode releases of <b><i><u>Case Closed: One Truth Prevails</u></i></b> have been delayed and past 3 episodes are yet to air, the lastest updates point the <i>next release </i> date at <b><u>12th March 2022</u></b>.<br>The irrgularity of Manga releases in your Language's irregular releases are no suprise to anyone, it's largely based on open-soucre contributions to publish the chapters.

      At these trying times, sites like <a href = "https://gogoanime.film/category/detective-conan">gogoanime.film</a> are more active than <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/235/Detective_Conan/episode">myanimelist.net</a> but still to get an instant one needs more.
